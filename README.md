<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cem Kar. I'm currently in the process of completing the Odin Project, going through it I hope to hone my developer skills. I've done front-end and back-end projects for many years now, previously it was a hobby, but now i'm trying to become industry-ready. I have previous experience with C++ and Java during my years in community college, but at the moment I've delineated from the standard computer science curriculmn to study a subject that's always interested me, philosophy. My main interest in philosophy pertains to the intersection of Computer Science and the study of Ethics. Aside from this, I enjoy reading literature, and am aspiring to be a published author someday. </p>
